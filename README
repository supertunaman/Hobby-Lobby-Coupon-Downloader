Hobby Lobby Coupon Downloader
Great for grandmas!

To deploy on windows:

1. Uncomment line 8 in main.cpp
2. Compile on a windows machine
3. Copy the following files to a new folder
    - HobbyLobbyCoupon.exe
    - QtCore4.dll
    - QtGui4.dll
    - QtNetwork4.dll
    - libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
    - mingwm10.dll
    - msvcrt.dll
4. Create a folder called "plugins", and then another called
   "imageformats" inside of that one. Copy qgif4.dll to that folder.
    - Optionally, copy whatever other image format plugins you feel
      like, just in case.
5. It should run out of that folder. From here, you should be able to
   make an installer using any off the shelf program.
